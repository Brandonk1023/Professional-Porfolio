# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

The reason for starting and building this project, was to create a portfolio landing page for future use.  Allowing me to have on condenced location to direct those who may need to view or gain access to my work.  This would allow me to easily and more efficiently share my work with others. In doing doing this project, I was able to further work on my CSS, and Flexbox basics.  I was able to learn more about coding layouts and style sheet mechanics.
